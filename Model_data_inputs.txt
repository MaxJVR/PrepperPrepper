Seattle
    --> Risk: High
    --> Seattle has fewer than ten buildings that have had more than one flood loss
    --> Seattle is right on the the coast giving it a high score'
Seattle:
Seattle.gov cites earthquakes as the most serious threat to Seattle. About 15% of Seattle's total area consists of liquifiable soil. They estimate a 7.0 could create 5,000- 30,000 landslides depending on how wet the soil is. Some of the outlying areas could be cut off for up to a month. The 820 or so unreinforced masonry buildings in Seattle are mostly concentrated in areas expected, and would not fare well.

Seattle:
Although Seattle has a slightly lower crime rate for it's size. Like any city, people will be the biggest concern in a calamity.


Spokane:
    --> Spokane is placed right over the Spokane river which Fema describes as a possible 'floodway'
    --> Risk: Moderate-High

Spokane:
While there was a swarm of 13 earthquakes in 2010, experts have never considered Spokane at a major risk of a large earthquake. Homefacts.com lists a 10% chance of a 5.0 quake in the next 50 years.
It is worth noting, that a similar swarm of quakes occurred in L'Aquila, Italy followed by a devastating M6.3 quake.

Spokane:
Having the 8th highest and large population, Spokane has potential for major risk of roving bands of marauders if the criminals got together after a catastrophe.


Bellevue:
    --> Risk: Minimal-Moderate
Bellvue shares a fault like with Seattle and has many of the same risks. There is a major potential for soil liquification at the Newport shores neighborhood by Lake Washington. There are many landslides that would happen around steep slopes, particularly east of Weowna Park.

Bellevue:
ranked the 37th safest city in Washington by safewise.com. Bellevue is a reasonably safe place, as long as the roving hoards don't migrate.


Vancouver:
Vancouver:
    --> Risk: Moderate
    --> Vancouver is wrapped around by the Columbia River
Vancouver has a many small earthquakes and a small overall danger. Anchor that narrow china display to the wall and you're set.

Vancouver:
Halfway between Spokane and Bellvue in crime rankings, Vancouver is a fairly save place. It is, however, right next to Portland, with a dense population and higher crime rate.


Everett:
    --> Risk: high
    --> Everett is surrounded by the Salish Sea putting it at a high risk for flooding.

With a fault line going through the city, and an abundance of old, unreinforced masonry buildings Everett has a high danger from an inevitable earthquake. Western neighborhoods with steep slopes are especially vulnerable to landslides and becoming isolated by impassible roads.

Everett:
With a higher crime rate than Seattle. If bands of marauders form in Washington, there will definitely be some formed here.
